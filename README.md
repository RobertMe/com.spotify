#Spotify for Homey Music

Lets you play your Spotify playlists and create mixed content playlists with Spotify songs.
Also enables you to play tracks and control playback on your spotify connect speakers.

This app only works with compatible speakers such as Sonos, Spotify desktop client, Spotify mobile client and other spotify connect enabled speakers.
This app does not work with the line-out speaker in Homey.

This app is based on the Spotify Connect API which is still in beta.
